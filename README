Overview:
	This program is utilizes the Huffman Coding Trie to compress/uncompress files.
	Compression occurs when we translate the Huffman code with bitwise I/O.

Compilation:
	To compile this program type "make" in the directory of this project.

Functionionality:
	compress.cpp: 
		./compress infile outfile
		1) Take in an input file to compress and an output file to write to.
		2) Read the contents of the infile and construct a Huffman code for
		   the contents of that file.
		3) Write the header for tree construction and a compressed bitwise
		   version of the code to the outfile.

	uncompress.cpp:
		./uncompress infile outfile
		1) Take in a compressed infile (outfile of compress).
		2) Use the contents of that file to reconstruct the original
		   file using the correct Huffman Coding Trie and code.
		3) Write the results to the outfile.

Notes:
	A separate git account was used during the creation of this project to keep
	it private while in production.
